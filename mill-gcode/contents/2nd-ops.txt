A finishing pass can be done by defining a counterbore hole and reselecting
the 'Return Location Enable' and the 'End of File Enable' on the 'Setup' tab
and selecting the 'Finish Path Only' check box on the '2nd Ops' tab in the
'Counterbore' section. Generate the G code then append the G code into your
file after the roughing pass.

will calculate the depth based on the 'Chamfer Diameter' (the OD of the
chamfer) the 'Tip Angle' and the 'Tip Width' (for a flat tip chamfer tool).
