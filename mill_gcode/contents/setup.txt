== Setup

The 'Setup' tab is where you set the behaviour of the machine when traversing
from hole to hole.

* 'Clearance Z' - The height to go to before going to the first hole
* 'Retract Z' - The height to go to after each 'Hole Op'
* 'Return Location'
** 'Relative X' - The X coordinate to go to based on the current offsets.
** 'Relative Y' - The Y coordinate to go to based on the current offsets.
** 'G53 Z' - The absolute height to raise the Z in machine coordinates.

To do a roughing pass then a finish pass on a counterbore the 'Return Location
Enable' and the 'End of File Enable' checkboxes have been provided. Please see
the link:2nd-ops.html[2nd Ops Page].
